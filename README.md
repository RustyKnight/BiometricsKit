# BiometricsKit

A simple API to make working with the biometrics and keychain in iOS simpler and less painful

The intention is to provide a simple mechanism for reading and writing data from and to the key chain, protected by the biometrics support in iOS

This makes use of the [Hydra](https://github.com/malcommac/Hydra) promises library to help improve the usability workflows.

Future version should make use of Swift's async/task workflows instead.
